80 friends is an app that challenges people to make friends from as many countries as they can. 

You can check and visually see on a map how many countries your friends list covers (based on their place of birth or place of current stay).
You can see a leaderboard (global or just among your friends) of the maximum number of countries covered. 

You can also register to make friends with people from countries where you do not currently have a friend. 
When somebody from that country needs a reciprocal friend, your names will be suggested to each other and 
you can decide whether to friend them. 

Deployment:
Run ant to build build/war/80friends.war
which can be deployed in any servlet container.
Mongodb must be running on the same machine.

History:
Initially built at the Hack for Change hackathon in San Francisco.
Inspired by my Pakistani Facebook friend (a former Stanford student) whose feed provides a more personal and organic 
view of Pakistan news than what's reported in mainstream media.
